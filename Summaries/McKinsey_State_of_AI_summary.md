## Document Status

✅ **This summary is based on the McKinsey Global Survey 2025 report** saved in this repository. It is intentionally high-level and focused on insights that are most relevant to SME AI adoption and to the AIOF/AIRMF frameworks.

For full details, charts, and methodology, refer to the original McKinsey material.

## Purpose and Scope

McKinsey’s "State of AI" survey tracks how organizations around the world:

- Are **adopting and scaling** AI across functions.  
- Are experimenting with **AI agents**.  
- Are seeing **business impact** (EBIT, cost, revenue, and qualitative outcomes).  
- Differ between **"high performers"** and everyone else.

The 2025 wave focuses in particular on:

- The early reality of **AI agents** in production.  
- The gap between **experimentation** and **organization-wide scaling**.  
- What distinguishes the small set of organizations seeing **material business impact** from AI.

## How to Use This Summary

- **For SME leaders:** Use this as context for where the market is headed and what "good" looks like, without assuming you need a Fortune 500 budget.  
- **For AIOF workshops:** Use the findings (especially on high performers, workflow redesign, and agent use) as **evidence** when discussing ambition levels and portfolio design.  
- **For AIRMF and governance:** Use the scaling and agent adoption data to ground conversations about when stronger risk and governance structures become necessary.

## Key Findings

### 1. AI use is broadening, but true scale is rare

- AI is now used in **multiple business functions** in many organizations:
  - More than two-thirds of respondents report AI use in **more than one function**.  
  - Roughly half say they use AI in **three or more functions**.
- However, **only about one-third** of organizations say they are **scaling** AI programs across the enterprise.
- **Company size matters:**  
  - Nearly half of organizations with **>$5B revenue** report reaching the scaling phase.  
  - Only ~**29%** of organizations with **<$100M revenue** say the same.

**Implication:** Broad experimentation is common, but enterprise-scale adoption is still the exception—especially for smaller companies.

### 2. AI agents: high interest, limited deployment

- AI agents are a focus of **buzz and experimentation**, particularly in:
  - Technology, media, and telecommunications.  
  - Healthcare.
- Most organizations that have started using agents:
  - Deploy them in **only one or two functions**.  
  - Are still in **early/exploratory** stages rather than full production scale.

**Implication:** Agents are promising but not yet mainstream at scale. For SMEs, this supports a **targeted, use-case-focused** approach rather than a rush to "agentize everything".

### 3. Impact so far: more qualitative benefits than large EBIT shifts

- Only about **39%** of respondents attribute **any level of EBIT impact** to AI.  
- Among those, most say **<5% of EBIT** is attributable to AI so far.
- However, many organizations report **enterprise-level qualitative benefits**, such as:
  - Improved **innovation**.  
  - Better **customer satisfaction**.  
  - Stronger **competitive differentiation**.

**Implication:** Hard financial impact at the enterprise level is still developing, but **innovation and customer outcomes** are already moving—useful framing for AIOF business cases.

### 4. Where costs and revenues are shifting

- **Cost benefits** are most commonly reported in:
  - **Software engineering**.  
  - **Manufacturing**.  
  - **IT operations**.
- **Revenue increases** from AI are most commonly reported in:
  - **Marketing and sales**.  
  - **Strategy and corporate finance**.  
  - **Product and service development**.

**Implication:** For SMEs, **go-to-market, product, and operational efficiency** are credible, empirically supported starting points for AI opportunities.

### 5. High performers (~6% of organizations)

McKinsey identifies a small group of **"AI high performers"** (about 6% of respondents), defined as organizations that:

- Attribute **≥5% of enterprise EBIT** to AI use, and  
- Report **"significant" value** from AI overall.

These high performers tend to:

- Have **bold, transformative ambitions** for AI (not just incremental efficiency).
- Use AI to **reimagine business models and workflows**, not merely speed up existing tasks.
- Move faster on **scaling**, with more investment and better transformation practices.
- Set AI objectives that include **growth and innovation**, not just cost reduction.
- **Redesign workflows intentionally**, which McKinsey notes has one of the strongest correlations with meaningful business impact.

**Implication:** Ambition and **workflow redesign** are key differentiators, not just model quality or tools.

## Implications for SMEs

While the survey covers organizations of all sizes, several patterns are directly relevant for SMEs:

- **You don’t need dozens of use cases** to see value. Many high performers are selective but ambitious, focusing on a handful of high‑impact areas and redesigning work around them.
- **Scaling is harder for smaller firms**—but SMEs may also have **less legacy** and can redesign workflows more quickly.
- **Agents are early-stage:** SMEs can benefit from being **fast followers**, focusing on specific domains (e.g., support, operations) rather than broad, organization-wide agents.
- **Focus on growth and differentiation, not only cost:**  
  Use cases in marketing, sales, and product can move the needle on revenue and market position, not just efficiency.

These insights can be woven into AIOF discovery conversations and AIRMF risk discussions as **market evidence** supporting or challenging different choices.

## Alignment with AIOF and AIRMF

### AIOF (AI Opportunity Framework)

- **Opportunity portfolio design:**  
  The survey’s emphasis on high performers using AI for **transformative change** supports AIOF’s focus on:
  - Distinguishing between **incremental** and **transformative** opportunities.  
  - Prioritizing a **small number of high‑impact** use cases.

- **Workflow-focused thinking:**  
  McKinsey’s finding that **workflow redesign** is strongly associated with impact aligns with AIOF’s process- and value-focused discovery questions.

- **Function focus:**  
  Cost and revenue impact patterns help AIOF sessions target:
  - Software/IT, manufacturing/operations for **efficiency**.  
  - Marketing/sales, product, strategy/finance for **growth**.

### AIRMF (AI Risk Management Framework)

- **Scaling and risk:**  
  As organizations—especially larger ones—move into **scaling** and **agent** deployments, risk and governance requirements increase. AIRMF can be positioned as the **practical risk overlay** for AIOF portfolios at this point.

- **Agentic AI considerations:**  
  The early-stage nature of agents, and their concentration in certain industries, supports AIRMF guidance to treat agents as **higher-governance** use cases with stronger controls and oversight.
