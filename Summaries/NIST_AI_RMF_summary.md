## Key Concepts and Definitions

### AI System
A machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments.

### AI Risk
The composite measure of an event's probability of occurring and the magnitude or degree of the consequences of the corresponding event. AI risks are often characterized by their potential to negatively impact AI system trustworthiness.

### Trustworthy AI
AI systems that are valid and reliable, safe, secure and resilient, accountable and transparent, explainable and interpretable, privacy-enhanced, and fair with harmful bias managed.

### AI Actor
An organization or person involved in at least one stage of the AI lifecycle (e.g., developers, deployers, users, evaluators).

### Impact Assessment
A process for identifying and evaluating potential impacts (both beneficial and harmful) of AI systems on individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and society.
