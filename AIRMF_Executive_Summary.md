# AIRMF Executive Summary (Public Overview)

**AI Risk Management Framework for SMEs**

---

## The Problem

As SMEs adopt AI, they face a new mix of risks that traditional risk frameworks don’t fully address on their own:

- **Technical risks** – Bias, inaccuracy, model failures, overfitting, unexpected behavior in new contexts.
- **Compliance risks** – Interactions with GDPR, the EU AI Act, sector-specific rules, and internal policies.
- **Ethical risks** – Unfair outcomes, lack of transparency, misaligned incentives.
- **Security risks** – Data poisoning, prompt injection, adversarial attacks, model exfiltration.

Without a structured approach, these risks are often discovered too late—during testing, after deployment, or when a regulator or customer raises concerns.

## The AIRMF Approach

AIRMF (AI Risk Management Framework) is a **workshop-based, SME-friendly process** that helps teams:

- Identify **AI-specific risks** early in an initiative.  
- **Assess and prioritize** those risks in a simple, transparent way.  
- Define **practical treatments and controls** with clear ownership.  
- Set up a **lightweight monitoring approach** so AI risks remain visible over time.

Typical outcomes over a short engagement (around 2–4 weeks) include:

- A list of **15–30 identified AI risks** linked to a specific system or opportunity.  
- **5–10 priority risks** with agreed treatment plans and owners.  
- A simple **tracking view or dashboard** to monitor risk status, controls, and follow-up actions.

## High-Level Process

AIRMF follows four stages that can be run as a focused series of workshops:

1. **Set Context**  
   - Define the AI system or opportunity in scope.  
   - Identify stakeholders and risk criteria (e.g., impact on customers, regulators, brand).  
   - Clarify how risk decisions will be made and by whom.

2. **Identify Risks**  
   - Facilitate a structured brainstorming session across **multiple risk categories** (technical, data, legal/compliance, ethical, security, operational, etc.).  
   - Capture risks in a simple register with descriptions and potential impacts.

3. **Assess & Prioritize**  
   - Use a **simple risk matrix** (e.g., likelihood × impact) to rate each risk.  
   - Highlight which risks are **critical, high, medium, or low** for the initiative.  
   - Select **5–10 priority risks** that require explicit treatment.

4. **Plan Treatment & Monitoring**  
   - Define **controls and actions** for each priority risk (technical, process, governance, or contractual controls).  
   - Assign **owners and timelines**.  
   - Decide how risk status will be **monitored and reviewed** alongside project progress.

The emphasis is on being **clear and actionable**, not on producing complex documentation that SMEs struggle to maintain.

## Typical Outcomes for SMEs

By the end of an AIRMF cycle, SMEs typically have:

- A **shared view of AI risks** across business, technology, and risk/compliance stakeholders.  
- A **prioritized list of risks** with agreed treatment plans and owners.  
- Early identification of potential **showstoppers** (e.g., regulatory or ethical concerns) before major investment.  
- A **lightweight monitoring approach** (often a simple dashboard or regular review slot) embedded into project governance.

## Relationship to Standards and Other Frameworks

AIRMF is intentionally aligned with the direction of leading standards and regulations while remaining practical for SMEs:

- **ISO/IEC 42001** – AIRMF can be one of the risk management components within an AI Management System.  
- **ISO/IEC 27005 & ISO 31000** – AIRMF follows familiar risk identification → assessment → treatment → monitoring cycles.  
- **NIST AI RMF** – AIRMF aligns with the **MAP**, **MEASURE**, and **MANAGE** functions for AI risk, focusing on SME-appropriate depth.  
- **EU AI Act** – AIRMF can help organizations understand and prepare for requirements associated with higher-risk AI systems (e.g., documentation, monitoring, incident handling).

AIRMF is designed to **complement AIOF**: AIOF focuses on opportunity discovery and prioritization, while AIRMF provides a structured way to evaluate and treat the risks of those opportunities.

## What Is Not Included Here

This public summary intentionally focuses on concepts and outcomes. It does **not** include:

- Detailed risk scoring formulas or threshold definitions.  
- Full workshop agendas, detailed checklists, or questionnaire content.  
- The specific templates used for registers, treatment plans, and dashboards.

Those elements form part of a proprietary consulting toolkit.

## When to Use AIRMF

AIRMF is most useful when:

- You are planning or running an AI initiative and want to **get ahead of risk** before launch.  
- Leadership or regulators are asking, "How are you managing AI risk?"  
- You want to connect AI initiatives to existing **risk, compliance, or security** functions without overburdening them.  
- You are combining AIOF and AIRMF to make **balanced decisions** that weigh both value and risk when choosing which AI opportunities to pursue.

AIRMF gives SMEs a structured but lightweight way to bring AI risk into the same conversation as AI opportunity and value.
