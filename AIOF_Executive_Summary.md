# AIOF Executive Summary (Public Overview)

**AI Opportunity Discovery Framework for SMEs**

---

## The Problem

Many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggle to turn AI interest into concrete action:

- **Too many ideas, no focus** – Everyone has AI ideas, but it’s unclear which ones really matter.
- **Analysis paralysis** – Overwhelmed by possibilities and uncertainty about where to start.
- **Unclear ROI** – Hard to build a business case leaders will actually approve.

Without a structured approach, AI discussions stay at the level of hype and experimentation rather than becoming an executable roadmap.

## The AIOF Approach

AIOF (AI Opportunity Framework) is a **short, workshop-based process** that turns “we should do something with AI” into a **prioritized, standards-aware portfolio of AI opportunities** for your business.

Over a short series of workshops, AIOF helps you:

- Identify **10–20 concrete AI opportunities** across your organization.
- Select **3–5 priority opportunities** using structured, transparent criteria.
- Produce **concise business cases** that describe value, feasibility, and key risks.
- Build a **6–12 month AI roadmap** that leaders can understand and act on.

AIOF is designed to be:

- **Fast** – Weeks, not months.
- **Practical** – Workshop-driven, not documentation-heavy.
- **Standards-aware** – Aligned with leading guidance (e.g., ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act) without being a compliance project.

## High-Level Process

At a high level, AIOF follows four stages:

1. **Set Business Context**  
   - Clarify business priorities, constraints, and success criteria.  
   - Identify an AI sponsor and a small group of champions.  
   - Align on what “good” looks like for AI in your organization.

2. **Discover Opportunities**  
   - Run cross-functional workshops to surface AI ideas across processes, products, and customer experiences.  
   - Use structured prompts (e.g., process, quality, value, customer, strategy lenses) to go beyond obvious use cases.  
   - Aim for a longlist of **10–20 candidate opportunities**.

3. **Evaluate & Prioritize**  
   - Score opportunities using a **simple, repeatable scoring model** (e.g., impact, feasibility, strategic fit, and risk profile).  
   - Visualize opportunities on a **portfolio matrix** (such as impact vs feasibility) to surface quick wins and strategic bets.  
   - Narrow down to **3–5 priorities** worth serious investment.

4. **Plan & Communicate**  
   - Create short, business-friendly descriptions and cases for each priority opportunity.  
   - Outline required resources, dependencies, and high-level milestones.  
   - Assemble a **6–12 month roadmap** with sequencing and quick wins.

This structure is flexible: it can be adapted to different sectors, levels of AI maturity, and governance requirements.

## Typical Outcomes for SMEs

By the end of an AIOF cycle, SMEs typically have:

- A **shared understanding** of where AI can create value in their context.
- A **shortlist of 10–20 ideas**, clustered into themes (e.g., automation, decision support, customer experience).
- A **prioritized portfolio** of **3–5 opportunities** agreed across business and technology leaders.
- **1–2 “no-regret” quick wins** ready to start immediately.
- A **tangible roadmap** that can be integrated into broader digital or AI strategies.

## Relationship to Standards and Other Frameworks

AIOF is designed to sit comfortably alongside well-known standards and frameworks:

- **ISO/IEC 42001** – Provides the management system context for AI; AIOF can feed into an AI Management System by supplying a structured opportunity pipeline.  
- **NIST AI RMF** – AIOF’s opportunity discovery and evaluation phases align with the **MAP** and **GOVERN** functions, and its outputs can be used as inputs to risk management activities.  
- **EU AI Act** – AIOF can flag where opportunities may fall into higher-risk categories, so that additional controls and assessments can be planned.

For risk and governance, AIOF is complemented by **AIRMF**, an AI risk management framework for SMEs. Together they support **balanced decisions** that consider both value and risk.

## What Is Not Included Here

This public summary intentionally stays high-level. It does **not** include:

- The scoring model or weighting used in evaluations.  
- The full workshop agendas, facilitation scripts, or slideware.  
- The specific templates (e.g., scorecards, business case formats, roadmap layouts).

Those elements form part of a proprietary delivery toolkit used in consulting engagements.

## When to Use AIOF

AIOF is most useful when:

- You have **growing interest in AI** but no clear, prioritized plan.  
- Different teams have **fragmented AI experiments** and you want a unified view.  
- Leadership is asking for a **credible AI roadmap** and business cases before committing budget.  
- You want to ensure AI opportunities are **aligned with strategy and regulatory expectations**, not just driven by technology.

AIOF gives you a structured, time-bounded way to move from diffuse ideas to a concrete, standards-aware AI opportunity portfolio.
