# AI Adoption For Business
  
This is an introduction to a practical, real-world framework to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) adopt AI safely and effectively.

The framework is composed of two main components:

- **AI Opportunity Framework ([AIOF](AIOF_Executive_Summary.md))**
- **AI Risk Management Framework ([AIRMF](AIRMF_Executive_Summary.md))**

This public repository contains **supporting research and reference material**, not yet the full framework itself. The goal is to make my sources and synthesis visible so you can see how the framework is grounded, without publishing the complete methodology.

## What this repo includes

- **AI capabilities & tools overview**
    - [AI capabilities and tools](AI_capabilities_and_tools.md) — a practical guide to:
      - What modern LLMs and agentic AI can actually do.
      - The 2025 AI tools landscape across functions (sales, marketing, operations, etc.).
      - Implementation considerations, costs, and common pitfalls.
      - Discovery workshop questions for finding high-value AI opportunities.
      - Selected real-world case studies and industry references (e.g., Anthropic’s use of AI in engineering work).

- **Governance, risk, and compliance summaries**
    - [EU AI Act summary](Summaries/EU_AI_Act_summary.md) — summary of the EU AI Act and what it means for businesses. ([YouTube Summary](https://youtu.be/QTUWY_SRLx0))
    - [NIST AI RMF summary](Summaries/NIST_AI_RMF_summary.md) — summary of the NIST AI Risk Management Framework. ([YouTube Summary](https://youtu.be/vX__BejukI8))
    - [ISO 42001 summary](Summaries/ISO_42001_summary.md) — notes on ISO/IEC 42001 (AI management systems). ([YouTube Summary](https://youtu.be/qZvBa9_5Jks))
    - These are written with SMEs in mind and connected to opportunity discovery and risk management.

- **Industry AI adoption frameworks**
    - [Consulting firms' AI adoption frameworks](Summaries/Consulting_Firm_AI_Adoption_Frameworks.md) — concise summaries of how major consulting firms structure AI adoption (phases, workstreams, trust/governance lenses), for market context and comparison. ([YouTube Summary](https://youtu.be/sO2JjcGNTXo))

- **Framework overviews (public summaries)**
    - [AIOF Executive Summary](AIOF_Executive_Summary.md) — high-level overview of the AI Opportunity Framework for SMEs.
    - [AIRMF Executive Summary](AIRMF_Executive_Summary.md) — high-level overview of the AI Risk Management Framework for SMEs.

## What this repo does *not* include

The **proprietary SME AI adoption framework** I use in my consulting work — including detailed process steps, scoring models, templates, and client deliverables — is **not** yet published here.

You can think of this repo as the **evidence base** and reference layer that the framework builds on.

## Sections

### AI Capabilities

High-level overview of how AI can create value for SMEs, with concrete examples and a catalog of capabilities and tools.  
See: [AI capabilities and tools](AI_capabilities_and_tools.md).

### Governance, Risk, and Compliance

Summaries of key standards and regulations that shape responsible AI adoption.

- **EU AI Act** — risk tiers, obligations, and timelines for different actors.  
    See: [EU AI Act summary](Summaries/EU_AI_Act_summary.md).

- **ISO/IEC 42001** — AI management system concepts and how they support governance.  
    See: [ISO 42001 summary](Summaries/ISO_42001_summary.md).

- **NIST AI RMF** — GOVERN / MAP / MEASURE / MANAGE model for AI risk.  
    See: [NIST AI RMF summary](Summaries/NIST_AI_RMF_summary.md).

### AI Frameworks from Big Consultancies

Short summaries of how major consulting firms structure AI adoption programs (phases, workstreams, typical deliverables). This is for market context and comparison, not a replication of their IP or mine.

### AIOF & AIRMF (Public Overviews)

High-level executive summaries of my own SME-focused frameworks:

- **AIOF (AI Opportunity Framework)** — workshop-based process for discovering and prioritizing AI opportunities.  
    See: [AIOF Executive Summary](AIOF_Executive_Summary.md).

- **AIRMF (AI Risk Management Framework)** — workshop-based process for identifying and treating AI risks.  
    See: [AIRMF Executive Summary](AIRMF_Executive_Summary.md).

## Who this is for

- SME leaders trying to understand **what’s realistically possible with AI**.
- Operators and product/tech leads looking for **structured opportunity discovery** prompts.
- Risk, governance, or compliance roles who need a **bridge between AI opportunities and regulatory frameworks**.

Over time I may expand or refine these documents, but the core SME AI adoption framework itself will remain separate from this public repository.
