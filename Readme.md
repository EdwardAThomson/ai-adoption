# AI Adoption For Business
  
  A practical, real-world framework to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) adopt AI safely and effectively.

  The framework is composed of two main components:

  - **AI Opportunity Framework (AIOF)**
  - **AI Risk Management Framework (AIRMF)**

  This public repository contains **supporting research and reference material**, not yet the full framework itself. The goal is to make my sources and synthesis visible so you can see how the framework is grounded, without publishing the complete methodology.

  ## What this repo includes

  - **AI capabilities & tools overview**
    - `AI_capabilities_and_tools.md` — a practical guide to:
      - What modern LLMs and agentic AI can actually do.
      - The 2025 AI tools landscape across functions (sales, marketing, operations, etc.).
      - Implementation considerations, costs, and common pitfalls.
      - Discovery workshop questions for finding high-value AI opportunities.
      - Selected real-world case studies and industry references (e.g., Anthropic’s use of AI in engineering work).

  - **Governance, risk, and compliance summaries**
    - `Summaries/EU_AI_Act_summary.md` — structured summary of the EU AI Act and what it means for businesses.
    - `Summaries/NIST_AI_RMF_summary.md` — summary of the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.
    - `Summaries/ISO_42001_summary.md` — notes on ISO/IEC 42001 (AI management systems).
    - These are written with SMEs in mind and connected to opportunity discovery and risk management.

  - **Industry AI adoption frameworks**
    - `Summaries/Consulting_Firm_AI_Adoption_Frameworks.md` — concise summaries of how major consulting firms structure AI adoption (phases, workstreams, trust/governance lenses), for market context and comparison.

  - **Framework overviews (public summaries)**
    - `AIOF_Executive_Summary.md` — high-level overview of the AI Opportunity Framework for SMEs.
    - `AIRMF_Executive_Summary.md` — high-level overview of the AI Risk Management Framework for SMEs.

  ## What this repo does *not* include

  The **proprietary SME AI adoption framework** I use in my consulting work — including detailed process steps, scoring models, templates, and client deliverables — is **not** yet published here.

  You can think of this repo as the **evidence base** and reference layer that the framework builds on.

  ## Sections

  ### AI Capabilities

  High-level overview of how AI can create value for SMEs, with concrete examples and a catalog of capabilities and tools.  
  See: `AI_capabilities_and_tools.md`.

  ### Governance, Risk, and Compliance

  Summaries of key standards and regulations that shape responsible AI adoption.

  - **EU AI Act** — risk tiers, obligations, and timelines for different actors.  
    See: `Summaries/EU_AI_Act_summary.md`.

  - **ISO/IEC 42001** — AI management system concepts and how they support governance.  
    See: `Summaries/ISO_42001_summary.md`.

  - **NIST AI RMF** — GOVERN / MAP / MEASURE / MANAGE model for AI risk.  
    See: `Summaries/NIST_AI_RMF_summary.md`.

  ### AI Frameworks from Big Consultancies

  Short summaries of how major consulting firms structure AI adoption programs (phases, workstreams, typical deliverables). This is for market context and comparison, not a replication of their IP or mine.

  ### AIOF & AIRMF (Public Overviews)

  High-level executive summaries of my own SME-focused frameworks:

  - **AIOF (AI Opportunity Framework)** — workshop-based process for discovering and prioritizing AI opportunities.  
    See: `AIOF_Executive_Summary.md`.

  - **AIRMF (AI Risk Management Framework)** — workshop-based process for identifying and treating AI risks.  
    See: `AIRMF_Executive_Summary.md`.

  ## Who this is for

  - SME leaders trying to understand **what’s realistically possible with AI**.
  - Operators and product/tech leads looking for **structured opportunity discovery** prompts.
  - Risk, governance, or compliance roles who need a **bridge between AI opportunities and regulatory frameworks**.

  ---

  Over time I may expand or refine these documents, but the core SME AI adoption framework itself will remain separate from this public repository.
