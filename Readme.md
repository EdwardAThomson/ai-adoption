 
# AI Adoption for SMEs

This repository is a **practical, SME-friendly resource** for adopting AI: where it creates value, what’s feasible today, and how to manage the risks.

This repository is **not** my full consulting methodology. It’s the **public evidence base / reference layer** that supports my SME AI adoption work—so you can see what it’s grounded in, without publishing the complete templates, scoring models, and client deliverables.

## What you’ll get from this repo

**1) Opportunity discovery (where AI helps)**

- A simple way to identify high-impact, realistic AI use-cases in an SME context.
- A pragmatic lens: what’s doable now, what’s hype, and what requires stronger foundations.

**2) Capability mapping (what AI can do today)**

- A curated overview of modern AI capabilities (LLMs, copilots, agents, automation patterns)
- Tooling notes: costs, pitfalls, and implementation considerations

**3) Responsible adoption (how to do it safely)**

- Plain-language governance and risk notes: how standards and regulation connect to day-to-day AI decisions.
